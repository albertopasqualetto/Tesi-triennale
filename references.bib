Elementary components of {MPAI} standards - {AI} Modules ({AIM}) - expose standard interfaces for operation in a standard {AI} Framework ({AIF}). As their performance may depend on the technologies used, {MPAI} expects that competing developers providing {AIMs} will promote horizontal markets of {AI} solutions that build on and further promote {AI} innovation.

	title = {Enhancing Preservation and Restoration of Open Reel Audio Tapes Through Computer Vision},
	abstract = {Analog audio documents inevitably face degradation over time, posing a challenge for preserving their audio content and ensuring the integrity of the recordings. Analog document preservation is one of the main research topics of interest of the Centro di Sonologia Computazionale ({CSC}) of the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padua, which over the years developed and implemented a methodology for preservation that includes, among other things, the video recording of the digitization process of the open-reel tapes for documenting irregularities on the top of their surface. Together with the corpus of digitized high-quality audio recordings, this led to the creation of an internal archive of video documents. This paper presents a software application that leverages computer vision techniques to automatically detect Irregularities on open-reel audio tapes, analyzing the video documents produced during the digitization interventions. The software employs a frame-by-frame analysis to automatically identify and highlight points of interest that may indicate tape damages, splices, and other Irregularities. The software uses Generalized Hough Transform and {SURF} algorithms to locate regions of interest within the tape. The proposed software is also part of the {MPAI}/{IEEE}-{CAE} {ARP} standard developed by Audio Innova s.r.l., spin-off of the {CSC}, and it may offer a robust and efficient solution for analyzing open-reel audio tapes, supporting archivists and musicologists in their activities.},

Findings – Among others, the study revealed that budgetary constraints, poor environmental controls, ill-equipped staff and technological obsolescence are the major challenges hampering the efforts of archival institutions in Sub Saharan Africa to manage and preserve {AV} archives. Research limitations/implications – The contextual differences due to existing political set ups in archival agencies in Sub Saharan Africa may or may not be receptive to some of the strategies suggested for the improvement of managing and preserving audio visual archives. Practical implications – The paper provides practical solutions which can inform policy and practice; thus, if adopted by archival agencies, the ﬁndings can add to improvements in the management and preservation of {AV} records.

The tape recorder needs to be set to the correct speed and equalization, and the magnetic tape could have some intentional or unintentional alterations. During both the creation and the musicological analysis of a digital preservation copy, the quality of the work may be affected by human inattention. This article presents a methodology based on neural networks to recognize and classify the alterations of a magnetic tape from the video of the tape as it passes in front of the tape recorder’s playback head. Furthermore, some machine-learning techniques have been tested to recognize a tape’s equalization from its background noise. The encouraging results open the way to innovative tools able to unburden audio technicians and musicologists from repetitive tasks and to improve the quality of their work.},

This paper, for the Sensors Special Issue on 800 Years of Research at Padova University, presents a review of the research in the ﬁeld of music technologies at Padova University by the Centro di Sonologia Computazionale ({CSC}), focusing on scientiﬁc, technological and musical aspects of interaction between musician and computer and between computer and audience. We discuss input devices for detecting information from gestures or audio signals and rendering systems for audience and user engagement. Moreover, we discuss a multilevel conceptual framework, which allows multimodal expressive content processing and coordination, which is important in art and music. Several paradigmatic musical works that stated new lines of both musical and scientiﬁc research are then presented in detail. The preservation of this heritage presents problems very different from those posed by traditional artworks. {CSC} is actively engaged in proposing new paradigms for the preservation of digital art.},
